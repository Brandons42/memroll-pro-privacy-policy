The privacy policy below is effective as of June 12, 2019 and applies to the MemRoll Pro app for iOS.
___
I, Brandon Suen, created this app with your privacy as one of my top priorities. Because I too use many apps, I understand the confusion and frustration that comes when apps request unnecessary information. Please read through this policy so that you are aware of what the usage of this app entails. I designed this app to involve as little user data collection as possible; however, if you disagree with this policy, please cease use of this app. By using this app, you agree to this policy.

## Information used
The only information this app records is stored locally on your phone, not on any databases that this app can access and share information from. This information includes the cities you've explored and guessed the location of and whether or not you have accepted the terms and conditions and privacy policy. That's it!

## Deleting your data
Because your information isn't scored on any databases for this app, uninstalling the app will remove this app's access to your data entirely.

## European Economic Area residents
European Economic Area residents who believe that this app is handling personal information in an unlawful manner have the right to contact local data protection authorities.

## Changes
Changes to this policy may occur. You should regularly check this policy in order to keep up with any modifications. The date on which the latest changes to this policy were put into effect can be seen at the top of the policy.
